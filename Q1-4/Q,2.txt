-- Explanation:
-- This function queries the database to retrieve the names of guilds with less than a specified number of members (memberCount).
-- It then iterates through the result set, printing the names of the guilds.
-- If no guilds are found with less than memberCount members, it prints a message indicating so.
-- Finally, it frees the result set to release resources.
