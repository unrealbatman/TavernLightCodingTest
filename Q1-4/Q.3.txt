-- Code Explanation:
-- This function removes a member from a player's party based on the provided playerId and memberName.
-- It first retrieves the player object using the playerId.
-- Then it retrieves the party object associated with the player.
-- Next, it creates a player object for the member to be removed.
-- It iterates over the members of the party and removes the matching member.
-- If the member is successfully removed, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
-- Improved error handling for player, party, and member existence.
